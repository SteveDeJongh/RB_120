##### RB 120 OOP Review ####

# March 17th RB 129 Study Session
=begin
RB 129 assessment FORMAT
Written:
3 Hour time limit

Interview:
Explaining concepts with code examples.

Notes:
Class objects relationships
Be able to produce code examples for concepts of OOP
Describe what concepts are at work.

The goal of the tests are to test our understanding of the concepts and our mental models.


# Example questions:
1)

class Dog
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

puppy = Dog.new('Benji')
another_puppy = Dog.new('Benji')

# What will this output? Why?

p puppy == another_puppy

# If we did run the code, what would be output on line 35 and why?

# On 35 we are checking the equality of two objects of the Dog class. The output is false, as the `==` method
# checks if the both objects are the same by object identity.

# In order to check equality via the instance variable names, we have to define a new `==` method inside the class.

attr_reader :name

def ==(other)
  name == other.name
end

# We would also have to create getter methods in order to access the name variable in the other object.

# 2)

# Tell us a little about `Method Access control` with a few examples.
# MAC is that excecise of using Public, private, and protected methods within a class's defintion.
# By default, all method defined in a class are public. The means that the method can be called anywhere in the codebase.
# Private methods can only be called from within the class and are hidden from calls from outside of the class definition.
# Protected methods are accessible to call from all instances of the same class.

# 3)

class Parent
  def hello(subject='World')
    puts "Hello, #{subject}"
  end
end

class Child < Parent
  def hello(subject)
    puts "How are you today?"
  end
end

child = Child.new
child.hello('Bob') #=> How are you today? # To call the Parent version, we can change the method names, or call super
# to call both hello methods.

# 4)

# class Cat
#   def initialize(name)
#     @name = name
#   end

#   def what_am_i?
#     self
#   end
# end

# fluffy = Cat.new('Fluffy')
# p fluffy.what_am_i? # what is output? #=> String represenation of the object with class name and any instance variables.

# class Cat
#   def initialize(name)
#     @name = name
#   end

#   def what_am_i?
#     self
#   end
# end

# class Persian < Cat; end

# fluffy = Persian.new('Fluffy')
# p fluffy.what_am_i? # what is output? #=> String represenation of the object with class name (this time persian) and any instance variables.

class Cat
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def what_am_i?
    self
  end

  def who_am_i?
    name # This is being called on `self`. 
  end

  def self.what_am_i?
    self
  end

  private

  attr_reader :name
end

class Persian < Cat; end

fluffy = Persian.new('Fluffy')
p fluffy.who_am_i? # Fluffy

p fluffy.what_am_i?.what_am_i? # Persian
