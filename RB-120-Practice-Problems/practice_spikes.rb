# Preschool (by Natalie Thompson) ~ 10 minutes

# Inside a preschool there are children, teachers, class assistants, a principle, janitors, and cafeteria workers.
# Both teachers and assistants can help a student with schoolwork and watch them on the playground. A teacher teaches
# and an assistant helps kids with any bathroom emergencies. Kids themselves can learn and play. A teacher and
# principle can supervise a class. Only the principle has the ability to expel a kid. Janitors have the ability
# to clean. Cafeteria workers have the ability to serve food. Children, teachers, class assistants, principles,
# janitors and cafeteria workers all have the ability to eat lunch.

# Nouns: Preschool, Children, teachers, class assistants, principle, janitors, cafeteria workers
# Verbs: help with schoolwork, watch playground, teaches, helps with bathroom emergencies, learn, play, supervise a class, expel, clean, serve food,
# eat lunch.
